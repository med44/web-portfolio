					<h2>Freshkills Park+ <small>2011</small></h2>
						<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>
					<p>	An augmented reality (AR) application for smartphones that allows visitors to Freshkills Park in Staten Island to navigate and understand features of the site as well as its transformation from landfill to park.</br></br>

						The former landfill presents a unique challenge for visitors since the installation of foundation-supported signs is prohibited by the presence of vast underground landfill infrastructure. The solution that Freshkills Park+ proposes is a virtual wayfinding system that consists of descriptive icons and texts overlaying the camera view of a user mobile device. Visitors see only the relevant information based on where the device is pointing, acting like a smart compass that helps them virtually navigate the park.</p>
